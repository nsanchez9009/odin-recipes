    <p><img style="max-width: 550px; max-height: 400px;" src="pancakes.jfif"</p>

    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>These pancakes are so light, they're going to float off the plate! and you don't even have to whip the egg whites.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup cold water or milk</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 cup ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated lemon zest</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1/8 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons self-rising flour</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <p><h3>Steps:</h3></p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk water and baking soda together in a mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Add ricotta cheese, lemon zest, vegetables oil, sugar, egg, and vanilla. Whisk until smooth, breaking up lumps of cheese as you mix.</li>
            <li>Add melted butter, lemon juice, and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons self-rising flour. Whisk together, stirring until most of flour disappears into the batter.</li>
            <li>Let batter sit at room temperature about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat lightly greased cast iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Portion out 1/4 cup scoops of batter onto skillet (cook in batches). When bubbles begin to form on the surface and the edges of the pancakes start to look dry (2 to 3 minutes), flip and cook other side until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a warm plate.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p><h3>Notes:</h3></p>
    <p>This recipe makes 2 large or 4 small servings. To make your own self-rising flour (2 cups worth): Sift together 2 cups all-purpose flour, with 2 teaspoons baking powder, and 1 teaspoon fine salt.</p>
